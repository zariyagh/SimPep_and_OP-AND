# SimPep and OP-AND

In this work, we introduce **OP-AND**, a curated public database of **osteogenic peptides**.  
We also propose a novel hypothesis: peptides derived from proteins involved in **osteoclast formation** may serve as **non-osteogenic**.  

Considering the limited availability of OP data, we present **SimPep**, a deep learning framework achieving:

- **Accuracy**: 92.93%
- **Specificity**: 96.64%
- **Sensitivity**: 70.58%  
(using 5-fold cross-validation)

| `NPP_Q5T9C2_ProtBERT_embeddings.txt` | Same as above, but from protein **Q5T9C2**. |
| `NPP_Q9CWT3_ProtBERT_embeddings.txt` | Same as above, but from protein **Q9CWT3**. |
| `NPP_random.txt` *(if present)* | Peptides derived from random proteins ‚Äî assumed non-osteogenic with no known osteogenic function. |
| `weights_only.weights.h5` | Trained weights of the final **Siamese model** used in SimPep. |
| `requirements.txt` | Python package dependencies for running the code and models. |
| `SimPep_Compelet_Model.ipynb` | Contains the full model architecture, training pipeline, and parameters ‚Äî easily modifiable. |
| `SimPep_App.ipynb` | Interactive notebook that loads the trained model and predicts the **osteogenic score** of a given peptide. |
